# RESTest
RESTest is a model-based testing framework that provides randomly generated test cases of an API from its specification. It mainly supports RESTful APIs described with the OAS design language.

## Description of the workflow
It is composed of the following steps:
* **Generation of the test configuration file.** Due to the inability to create test cases only with the API documentation, the framework implements a functionality which automatically creates a test configuration file from the API specification. It specifies the necessary authorization data (e.g. an API key) and provides sample values to a specific parameter, inter alia information. These automatically generated files should be edited to augment it, as they are quite simple. You can look up the [test configuration file documentation in our wiki.](https://github.com/isa-group/RESTest/wiki)
* **Generation of abstract test cases.** Once the test configuration file has been generated and edited, RESTest is able to create test cases using a specific data generator. Each test case includes the necessary parameters to be properly executed. These test cases are domain-independent, so they can be instantiated in any framework.
* **Generation of REST-Assured test cases.** Next step is to concretize the abstract test cases, instantiating them in a framework using a [source code writer](https://github.com/isa-group/RESTest/blob/develop/src/main/java/es/us/isa/restest/testcases/writers/RESTAssuredWriter.java). RESTest uses [REST Assured](https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured) to test and validate the RESTful APIs. The source code writer generates a Java class with JUnit test cases ready to be executed.
* **Execution of test cases.** Finally, the JUnit test cases are run. At the time this README was last edited (March 2020), the test cases check if a nominal request receives a 2XX status code class, or if a faulty request that violates an individual parameter constraint or an inter parameter dependency receives a 4XX status code class. Plus, they verify if the status code class of the API response is not 5XX, which denotes an internal server error. The test suite also analyzes every response body, checking if they match with the schema of the response body that describes the OpenAPI specification.
* **Computation of statistics.** Once the test cases are executed, RESTest computes the results and displays them in a GUI. The GUI provides a straightforward visualization of bugs and API coverage using charts. RESTest uses [Allure framework](http://allure.qatools.ru/) to implement the interface. RESTest also analyzes the coverage of the tests performed, using a self-made catalogue of coverage criteria that are classified into 8 coverage levels; the higher the level, the more code will be covered in the test suite. The criteria are divided into two types - input criteria, that measure the coverage of the elements related to API requests (e.g. paths, operations or parameters), and output criteria, that measure the coverage of the elements related to API responses (e.g. status code, response body properties or content-type).

 ## Test coverage criteria
 The criteria are divided into two types: input criteria and output criteria.
 1. Input criteria. They measure the coverage of the elements related to API requests.
     1. Path coverage. The criterion is related with the paths tested by a test suite. Each path of the API must be addressed to achieve 100% coverage.
     1. Operation coverage. The criterion is related with the operations executed by a test suite. Each allowed HTTP verb of every path must be tested to achieve 100% coverage.
     1. Parameter coverage. The criterion is related with the operation parameters used by a test suite. Each input parameters of every operations must be used to achieve 100% coverage.
     1. Parameter value coverage. The criterion is related with the parameter values exercised by a test suite. Each boolean and enum parameter must take all possible values to achieve 100% coverage.
     1. Content-type coverage. 
     1. Operation flow coverage.

### Things to take into account
* If you want to obtain coverage stats in CSV, you need to create a [CSVReportManager](https://github.com/isa-group/RESTest/blob/master/src/main/java/es/us/isa/restest/util/CSVReportManager.java), but also modify the [Writer](https://github.com/isa-group/RESTest/blob/master/src/main/java/es/us/isa/restest/testcases/writers/RESTAssuredWriter.java). The reason for this is that output coverage (status codes, response body properties...) can only be computed after the test suite is executed, therefore the Writer needs to instrument the code to compute the output coverage after running the automatically generated test cases. The code should be similar to the following:
```java
CSVReportManager csvReportManager = new CSVReportManager(testDataDir, coverageDataDir);
RESTAssuredWriter writer = new RESTAssuredWriter(...);

// YOU NEED TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING TWO LINES TO COMPUTE OUTPUT COVERAGE
writer.setEnableStats(true);
writer.setAPIName(APIName);
```
